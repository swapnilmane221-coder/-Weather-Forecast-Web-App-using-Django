# -Weather-Forecast-Web-App-using-Django
This is a responsive Django web app that fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can search by city to view temperature (°C/°F), humidity, pressure, description, and an icon. It uses modern CSS, supports GET queries, and handles invalid inputs gracefully.
